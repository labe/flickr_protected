TO IMPLEMENT:
* Error page for /users/:username when :username does not exist
* Ability to "approve" being added as someone's contact? (friends vs followers models)
* auto populate User name fields on /settings for real-time "That user does not exist :(" notification

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< more notes!

User can:

* Make account private
* Add contacts
* Block users
* See which users they've added as contacts
* See which users they've blocked
* See who has added them as a user


If user1's account is private
* Only logged in users who have been added as a contact can view that user's profile page or albums

If user1's account is public
* Anyone can view user1's profile page and albums, unless they have been blocked by user1
